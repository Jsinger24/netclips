# NetClips

NetClips is a mobile responsive video sharing platform where users can view, like, dislike, and comment on videos. 
Users will be able to view videos without authentication. After registering and verifying a user account, 
the user will gain the ability to upload their own content onto the platform for worldwide sharing. 
In addition, they will be able to keep track of their uploaded videos, and delete if desired.

The web application will be scaffolded using JHipster, with Spring Boot as the backend and mySQL for data persistence. 
Coded in Java. Front-end will be developed using the React framework.
